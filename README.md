# TicTacToe-Game/ Paint
This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game developed for UConn's ECE dept.
-The game uses an SD card to load images to the game, husky is replacing "X", and a basket ball is replacing "O"
-Paint feature is added, you can draw on the LCD with multiple colors
-Arduino UNO, and a 3.5 inch TFT screen were used in this project
-Just plug in the LCD shield to the arduino and upload the code, it's plug and play :)
-You might have to calibrate the LCD if another model is used.
-The project is designed for 480x320 LCD's
